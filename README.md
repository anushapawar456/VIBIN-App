PROBLEM STATEMENT
MUSIC RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
Objective:
The objective of this competition is to design and implement Music Player. Participants are expected to apply data structures and algorithms to implement below tasks for design and implementation of music player.

OUR SOLUTION
Our group of 3 have implemented music player with all these features using a TREE data structure that too with Binary Search Tree.This way each node has a name of artist and songs connected down below.Apart from 
aldready built in music apps we have tried to implement to have more user to user engagement by making it more personalized.For storing a Space of O(N) taken and Time Complexity is O(Log N) making it quite optimal 
as compared to linear ones.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Eclipse 
2. Figma Design Tool
3. Java
4. Data Structures and in-built libraries

FUTURE SCOPE
The model has a huge scope of expansion.
In terms of user-friendly features, it could be done as follows:
1. Integrate this with a social media so that users can connect with friends and share music
2. Design recommendation algorithm on the basis on each individual's music tree
3.Connect with peers and new groups with similar music interests(finding common music)

In terms of real life applications, following are some of the domains this could be used in:
1. For working professionals, finding friends in new cities with similar music taste.
2. In terms of time complexity, it is much better than using of linear data structure.
3. Fast retrieval and flow of music playlist in  a Tree Data Structure.
